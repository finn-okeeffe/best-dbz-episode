# best-dbz-episode
Another data project examining how online communities have rated the episodes of Dragon Ball Z. I analyse and compare data from IMDb, MyAnimeList, and Reddit.

## Methodology
In [getting_data.ipynb](https://github.com/finn-okeeffe/best-dbz-episode/blob/main/getting_data.ipynb), I state my data sources, obtain the data using APIs and web scraping, then clean it and store it in .csv files stored inside the data/ folder.

In [analysis_and_visualisation.ipynb](https://github.com/finn-okeeffe/best-dbz-episode/blob/main/analysis_and_visualisation.ipynb), I analyse this cleaned data. Looking at the best episodes, the worst episodes, and how the datasets compare to each other.

## Results
Below is the breakdown by episode for the IMDb dataset, with the best and worst episodes annotated. Each episode is given a star rating 0 to 10.

Below is the breakdown by episode for the MyAnimeList dataset, with the best and worst episodes annotated. Each episode is rated in a poll in the forums, resulting in an average rating ranging from 0 to 5.
